## Abstract
We are building a social media app, named BITSgram. The app will support generic social media functionalities like Posting/Viewing text. We will also include full authentication. The app is built using NodeJS/ExpressJS, ReactJS, and SQL. The main motive of this project is to design an efficient database for handling user data and post data. We can post, delete, and update data in real time in the database. Our app can be used to create a modernized online web of users and can be deployed for real-time use on the campus. Regarding the security of the web app, we plan on protecting it against SQL injection attacks and other authentication loopholes. Concluding, we think the app can be deployed for full-time use across the campus. 

##Functionalities supported:

●	Upload/download posts.
●	Authentication
●	Like, share other's posts
●	Delete your own posts.
●	Show user’s feed
●	Comment on others’ posts.
●	Follow multiple other users.
●	Security(Cannot enter any page other than the home page without login)
●	Chat between various users.
●	Secure to SQL Injections due to filtering of posts, users, and passwords.

##Tech Stack

Node js - Node.js is a server environment. Node.js uses JavaScript on the server. 

MySql - MySQL is a relational database management system. We will be making use of the MySQL workbench, as it is available across all the platforms (mac, Windows, etc) unlike Oracle DB.

React - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. It helps to design simple views for each state in our application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when our data changes.

Sequelize - Sequelize is a third-party package to be precise it's an Object-Relational Mapping Library(ORM).

Figma - It will be used for wireframing and information architecture.

CORS, AXIOS, etc are many other JavaScript libraries that we will be using for routing and establishing connections.

Postman -  For API testing and validating requests(get, post, put, delete).

Express - The primary use of Express is to provide server-side logic for web and mobile applications and as such it's used all over the place. Simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, and scalability are some of its characteristics and since it is made in NodeJS itself, it inherited its performance as well.
